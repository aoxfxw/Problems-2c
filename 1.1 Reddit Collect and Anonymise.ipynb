If you can see it in the poem and can logically explain why you interpret it that way, then it’s right.  Poems are like songs. When they are in the writer’s head, they have one meaning.

In order to get 24/24, you need to name both language and structural methods and talk about the effects of both perceptively and in detail. ‘Perceptive’ just means, ‘say something interesting/ original about the method and its effect, and link that directly to the question’.   So a perceptive point on structure in ‘Scaffolding’ might be something like,   ‘Heaney writes in 5 stanzas of couplets, mirroring the layered look of scaffolding as it supports a building. The first couplet, “building”/ “scaffolding” is a half rhyme, implying that the metaphorical “wall” of their relationship is not yet secure. However, the final couplet, “let the scaffolds fall”/ “confident that we have built our wall” is a satisfying-sounding full rhyme, emphasising the solidity of their relationship - they do not need to seek outside help to stay together any more, as they are a cohesive unit; they rhyme with each other. Heaney’s use of an iambic rhythm in the final phrase - “that we have built our wall” - further reinforces the sense of completeness and solidity, as iambs are intended to mimic a human heart beat. Moreover, the fact that Heaney writes in blank verse, with 10 syllables in each line, implies that even in the uncertain moments of the relationship, the foundations of it were always fairly solid.’  That would be a full marks job I reckon. However, you don’t need to mention structure at all to get into the top band.

I missed out the R, because I didn't have enough time, but the C paragraph was about how Sheila changed but Gerald didn't, so that is the reason Sheila wouldn't take the ring back - she adopted socialist views, which gave her the confidence to make her own decision about her marriage.
